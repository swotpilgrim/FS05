## ACT 1: SETUP & RECRUITMENT (Chapters 1-8)

Grace Harlow is deployed to Alaska to hunt Soviet saboteur "The Trapper." Mission becomes personal when she realizes he murdered her uncle Thomas two years ago. Must capture him alive for interrogation despite desire for revenge.

### Chapter 1: Equipment Failure

Grace Harlow is working pipeline maintenance at mile marker 347, November 1979. Routine inspection of pressure valves. Her gut screams wrongness—something feels off about valve assembly though diagnostics show normal. She evacuates crew section immediately. Thirty minutes later, catastrophic valve explosion destroys entire work area. Would have killed twelve men if Grace hadn't trusted her instinct. CIA handler Frank Dockery observes incident report—confirms Grace is ready for field deployment. Her PROJECT CASSANDRA training is operational. Chapter ends with Dockery making encrypted call: "She's ready. Send her to Alaska."

### Chapter 2: The Murder

Flashback to two years ago, winter 1977. Grace receives call that Uncle Thomas is missing on hunting trip near Denali. Search teams find body three weeks later. Official ruling: bear attack. Grace examines body at morgue—wounds are wrong. Clean knife cuts, not claw marks. Placement is deliberate, throat slashed first. Location was wrong too—Thomas knew bear territory, wouldn't make fatal mistakes. She investigates quietly, finds Thomas's journal mentioning "trapper" client who felt wrong, asked too many questions about radar installations. Grace brings evidence to local police. Dismissed as grief, case closed. Thomas buried, murderer unpunished. Grace buries her rage, waits.

### Chapter 3: Recruitment Flashback

Flashback to Grace's PROJECT CASSANDRA recruitment, spring 1977. After second equipment failure prediction saved lives, CIA approached her. Offered explanation for ability she'd never understood—predictive pattern recognition, legitimate cognitive skill. Training would weaponize it for intelligence work. Grace skeptical but intrigued—pipeline work was brutal, killed her father, maybe her "curse" could serve bigger purpose. Accepted recruitment. Eighteen months at undisclosed facility learning threat assessment, danger forecasting, trusting gut instinct under operational pressure. Graduated top of class. Now she's operational asset. Chapter ends with Grace completing final training exercise perfectly—handler tells her she's ready for real mission.

### Chapter 4: Mission Briefing

Present day. Dockery briefs Grace in Anchorage safe house. Mission: locate and capture Viktor Sokolov, Soviet GRU deep-cover agent operating as wilderness guide under alias "The Trapper." Been in Alaska 15 years, perfect cover. Intel suggests he's planning trans-Alaska pipeline sabotage—explosives at critical points, timed for maximum economic damage. Sabotage imminent within 72 hours. Grace must capture him alive—he's valuable intelligence asset with knowledge of entire Soviet network in North America. Secondary objective: locate and disarm explosives. When Dockery shows photo, Grace recognizes him. This is the man from Thomas's journal. The trapper Thomas guided before his death. Her uncle's killer. She keeps face neutral, accepts mission. Dockery provides equipment, satellite radio, snowmobile. Grace deploys alone.

### Chapter 5: Into the Wilderness

Grace flies into Denali region via bush plane. Establishes forward base at Maintenance Station Omega, mile marker 347. Temperature dropping to ten below, winter coming hard. She studies pipeline maps, identifies likely sabotage points based on structural vulnerability. Uses PROJECT CASSANDRA training to predict where The Trapper would strike—maximum damage, minimum exposure. Her intuition keeps pulling toward remote section near Box Canyon. Something feels wrong there. Grace gears up: Winchester rifle, Colt .45, survival kit, radio. Takes snowmobile into wilderness. First night alone in kill-or-be-killed terrain. She's hunting the man who murdered Thomas. Mission parameters say capture alive. Her gut says kill him. Chapter ends with Grace finding first evidence—snowmobile tracks, recent, heading toward pipeline access tunnel.

### Chapter 6: First Cache

Grace follows tracks to pipeline access tunnel, remote location thirty miles from nearest human. Finds concealed explosive cache—Soviet military-grade C-4, sophisticated timing device, enough to destroy two miles of pipeline. This is real. The Trapper is preparing sabotage, not just intelligence gathering. Grace photographs evidence, sends encrypted burst transmission to Dockery via satellite radio. Handler orders her to disarm cache and continue tracking target—capture priority. Grace hesitates. Disarming cache reveals her presence to The Trapper. But leaving explosives in place risks pipeline. She makes tactical decision: disarms cache. Knows she's sacrificed stealth advantage. The Trapper will know someone's hunting him now. Grace secures area, continues tracking. Temperature dropping. Darkness coming.

### Chapter 7: The Trapper's Cabin

Grace finds The Trapper's base camp—remote log cabin, thirty miles from nearest road. Approaches carefully. Finds modified bear traps around perimeter—designed for humans. Savage and effective. Disables three traps, enters through window. Inside: radio equipment hidden under floorboards, detailed pipeline maps, timing devices, explosives. Journal in Russian. One entry stops her cold—detailed description of killing "guide Thomas" in November 1977. Describes Thomas's death clinically: throat cut, body staged as bear attack, took three days to die. Kept Thomas's hunting knife as trophy. Grace finds the knife. Rage threatens to overwhelm discipline. She forces control. Finds intel on three more explosive caches. Photographs everything, transmits to Dockery. Exits before The Trapper returns. But she's left traces—he'll know someone was here.

### Chapter 8: Ambush

Grace tracking toward second cache when her intuition screams danger. Dives behind granite outcrop as gunfire erupts—high-powered rifle, professional accuracy. The Trapper has ambushed her. Grace pinned down, wounded (shoulder graze), no escape. The Trapper calls out: "You found my cabin. Impressive. CIA? NSA?" He's calm, confident. Grace realizes she walked into trap. He used second cache as bait, predicted her approach. She's not the hunter—she's prey. The Trapper fires suppressing bursts, moving to flank. Grace uses smoke grenade, escapes during confusion. Runs wounded through darkening wilderness. The Trapper pursuing. Mission sideways. She's burned, hunted, bleeding. Act 1 ends with Grace disappearing into forest, The Trapper's laughter echoing behind her.

---

## ACT 2: OPERATION & ESCALATION (Chapters 9-22)

Grace survives The Trapper's hunt while working to stop pipeline sabotage. Cat-and-mouse game escalates. Spy paranoia deepens—is Dockery using her? Mission shifts from capture to survival to counter-hunt.

### Chapter 9: Survival

Grace runs through wilderness, wounded and hunted. The Trapper is professional tracker—she can hear him moving through forest, methodical and patient. Temperature dropping fast, darkness falling. Grace's shoulder bleeding but not critical. She uses evasion tactics from PROJECT CASSANDRA training: doubles back, crosses frozen stream to break scent trail, climbs granite outcrop to assess pursuit. Spots The Trapper below—older man, barrel-chested, moves like predator. He's carrying Thomas's hunting knife on his belt. Grace's rage flares but she forces discipline. Can't fight him directly, he has advantage. She needs to survive night first. Finds shelter in rock formation, treats wound, radios Dockery. Handler orders immediate extraction. Grace refuses—three more explosive caches out there, sabotage timeline accelerating. If she extracts, The Trapper wins. Dockery threatens to pull her authorization. Grace ignores him, cuts transmission. She's committed now. Mission has become personal.

### Chapter 10: Pattern Recognition

First night in wilderness. Grace cold, wounded, but alive. She hears The Trapper making camp half-mile away—sees his fire. He's not worried about concealment. Confident. Grace uses night to analyze situation. The Trapper is doing two things simultaneously: hunting her and prepping sabotage. He can't abandon either objective. That's his weakness. Grace plots remaining explosive cache locations based on intelligence from cabin. Uses her predictive intuition to map his operational pattern. He'll check caches in sequence, ensure they're undiscovered. That gives Grace targeting solution. Instead of running, she'll track him. Use his operational schedule against him. Dawn breaks cold and clear. Grace watches The Trapper break camp, move northwest. She follows at distance. Hunter and prey reversing roles.

### Chapter 11: The Second Cache

Grace follows The Trapper to second explosive cache—pipeline access point near frozen river. He's checking timing device, ensuring it's operational. She observes from high ground, photographs him through rifle scope. Has clear shot. Could kill him now. But mission orders are capture alive. He's valuable intelligence asset. Grace hesitates. In that moment, The Trapper's head snaps up—senses something wrong. Grace's PROJECT CASSANDRA intuition screams warning. She moves as he fires toward her position. Missed her by inches. He knew she was there. Both disappear into wilderness, repositioning. Tense silence. Grace realizes The Trapper has instincts too—fifteen years deep-cover survival, honed predator awareness. This won't be easy. She withdraws, circles to cache. Disarms it after he leaves. That's two caches secured. Two more to go.

### Chapter 12: Radio Intercept

Grace returns to Maintenance Station Omega to warm up and resupply. Intercepts Soviet radio transmission on frequency found in The Trapper's cabin. Moscow handler pressuring for sabotage execution—pipeline strike scheduled for 72 hours from now. The Trapper responds: complications have arisen, possible CIA presence. Moscow handler insists mission proceed regardless. The Trapper acknowledges. Grace realizes timeline just accelerated. He'll trigger remaining explosives early if necessary. She has less time than she thought. Radios Dockery with intel. Handler congratulates her on disarming two caches but repeats orders: capture target alive. Grace questions why solo operative instead of extraction team if he's so valuable. Dockery deflects—CIA resources in Alaska are limited, can't risk exposure. Grace's paranoia activates. Something feels wrong about this mission. Is Dockery protecting larger agenda?

### Chapter 13: Counter-Hunt

Grace makes tactical decision: aggressive pursuit. She's been reactive, letting The Trapper dictate engagement. Time to go offensive. She knows his remaining cache locations, understands his operational pattern. Uses PROJECT CASSANDRA training to predict his movements. Sets up observation post on ridge overlooking third cache location. Waits twelve hours in freezing cold. The Trapper arrives at dusk, checks cache. Grace shadows him as he returns to secondary camp. She's learning his rhythm, his tells, his patterns. He's confident but not careless. Former Spetsnaz by how he moves. Combat-trained, wilderness expert. But he's older, carrying gear, operating on timeline pressure. Grace is younger, lighter, motivated by rage she's channeling into cold focus. She starts psychological warfare: leaves signs she's been at his camps, disables his traps, takes his supplies. Making him know he's being hunted.

### Chapter 14: Evidence of Evil

While tracking The Trapper, Grace finds evidence of previous kills. Buried cache containing trophies—photos of bodies, personal items, journal entries in Russian. Twelve victims over fifteen years. Hunters, hikers, geologist, fishing guide. Thomas Harlow is entry number nine. Each kill documented clinically: method, duration, disposal. The Trapper stages deaths as wilderness accidents—bear attacks, falls, exposure. Perfect cover for deep-cover agent eliminating threats. Grace photographs everything, transmits to Dockery. This is war crimes evidence, multiple murders. The Trapper isn't just spy—he's serial killer who enjoys his work. Grace's resolve hardens. Capture-alive order conflicts with justice. These twelve victims deserve more than intelligence debriefing. She continues tracking, knowing her choice is coming.

### Chapter 15: Third Cache

Grace reaches third cache before The Trapper. Positioned at critical pipeline junction—destruction would cause maximum economic damage and environmental catastrophe. She begins disarming using CIA radio guidance. Halfway through, hears snowmobile. The Trapper is early. Grace stays, working frantically. He arrives, spots her tracks. She finishes with two minutes to spare, grabs components, runs. The Trapper pursues on foot. Chase through frozen wilderness. Grace leads him toward unstable ice section of river. He realizes trap, stops pursuit. Standoff across frozen river. The Trapper calls out: "You're good. Thomas's niece?" Grace freezes. He knows who she is. Laughs. "He talked about you before he died. Proud of his mechanic niece. When CIA sent operative, I knew it might be you." Psychological warfare. Grace withdraws. Both know this is personal.

### Chapter 16: Handler Pressure

Dockery radios Grace with urgent transmission. Three caches disarmed, excellent work. Now extract and let CIA bring in team for capture. Grace refuses—fourth cache still active, The Trapper still operational. Dockery reveals he knows about Thomas Harlow connection. Investigated Grace's background before assigning mission. He sent her deliberately, knowing it was personal. Testing if PROJECT CASSANDRA operative can separate revenge from duty. Grace realizes she's being used—not just to stop sabotage, but as program validation test. If she succeeds professionally despite personal stake, program is validated. If she kills for revenge, program is discredited. She's pawn in CIA internal politics. Dockery confirms: capture The Trapper alive, prove program works. Grace's paranoia crystallizes. Everyone's using her. Mission isn't about pipeline or intelligence—it's about bureaucratic agendas. She cuts transmission. Will finish mission her way.

### Chapter 17: The Trapper's Offer

The Trapper initiates radio contact—he's using CIA frequency, monitored her transmissions. Proposes deal: he'll reveal other Soviet deep-cover agents in North America for 48-hour head start. Claims he's burned, Moscow will eliminate him for mission failure. Willing to trade intelligence for survival. Grace questions legitimacy. Real offer or trap? She plays along, agrees to meet. Sets meeting at abandoned pipeline shack. Both arrive armed, wary. The Trapper is weathered, cold-eyed, carrying Thomas's knife. Describes killing Thomas almost fondly—worthy opponent, fought well, took three days. Grace's rage barely contained. The Trapper watches her. "You want to kill me. But your orders say capture alive. That's your weakness—you still follow orders." He's probing, testing discipline. Grace maintains control. Rejects deal. The Trapper withdraws calmly. "Fourth cache triggers in 24 hours. Find it before then." Gone. Grace knows he's heading to command post to activate final sabotage.

### Chapter 18: Box Canyon

Grace's intuition pulls her toward Box Canyon—narrow granite formation, quarter-mile long, 50-foot walls. Her gut has screamed wrongness about this location since mission start. Fourth cache must be here. She approaches carefully. Canyon floor shows no obvious signs but instinct insists danger. Grace enters, sweeping for explosives. Finds cache in rock crevice—massive C-4, sophisticated dead-man trigger. If The Trapper doesn't input disarm code by noon tomorrow, it triggers automatically. Also triggers if tampered. Grace can't disarm it—needs his code. She's examining device when instinct screams. Dives as rockslide crashes behind her—retreat blocked. Gunfire from canyon rim. The Trapper positioned on high ground. Grace pinned in kill box. This was trap. He used cache as bait. Grace trapped, wounded (leg shot), no escape. The Trapper calling down: "Predictable. Your instinct brought you here. My instinct prepared for you."

### Chapter 19: Pinned

Grace trapped in Box Canyon, wounded and exposed. The Trapper has perfect position—high ground, multiple angles, she's in open kill zone. He's firing controlled bursts, keeping her pinned. Not trying to kill her yet—enjoying the hunt. Grace assesses situation: leg wound serious but mobile, limited ammunition, no cover, sunset approaching. Temperature dropping fast. If she stays pinned here overnight, hypothermia will kill her. The Trapper knows this, settles in to wait. Grace uses last smoke grenade to obscure his sight lines, limps to canyon wall. Finds narrow crevice, wedges inside. Defensible position but still trapped. Night falls. The Trapper lights fire on canyon rim—psychological warfare, showing his comfort while she freezes. Grace tends wounds, conserves ammunition. Her PROJECT CASSANDRA intuition quiet—no clear escape presents itself. She's in genuine crisis. Mission failed, she's going to die in this canyon. Unless she can turn trap against trapper.

### Chapter 20: The Confession

The Trapper calls down from rim, conversational. Long night ahead, might as well talk. He describes his career—fifteen years deep cover, perfect operation until Thomas Harlow recognized him from old GRU intelligence photo. Had to eliminate Thomas. Describes murder in detail: caught him in wilderness, tortured for information about who else knew, killed him slowly over three days. Staged bear attack perfectly. Kept knife as trophy because Thomas fought well—respected that. Grace listening from crevice, rage building. The Trapper continues: killed twelve people over years, each elimination necessary for operational security. Enjoys the work—wilderness is perfect killing ground, bodies disappear, accidents are believable. Grace realizes he's theatrical, needs audience. His isolation has made him hungry to share accomplishments. She exploits this: asks questions, keeps him talking. While he monologues, she's reading him. PROJECT CASSANDRA training showing his patterns—rhythm of attention, when he's distracted, his tells. Learning him.

### Chapter 21: Reversal

Dawn breaks. The Trapper descends into canyon—time to finish hunt. Grace appears defeated, weakened by wounds and cold. He approaches cautiously but confidently. Describes how he'll stage her death—fell during pursuit, exposure killed her. CIA will never know truth. Gets within ten feet. Grace's PROJECT CASSANDRA intuition has been tracking his pattern all night. She sees the moment—his weight shifts wrong, attention lapses for one second. She moves. Not away—toward. Tackles him before he can raise rifle. Brutal close-quarters fight. The Trapper is larger, stronger, combat-trained. But Grace is fighting for Thomas, channeling two years of rage into focused violence. She uses canyon environment—smashes his head against rock wall, breaks his rifle, gets Thomas's knife from his belt. Reversal complete. Grace has knife at his throat. Mission parameters echo: capture alive. He's valuable intelligence asset. Kill him and mission fails. Her choice.

### Chapter 22: Choice Point

Grace has The Trapper pinned, knife at throat. Two years waiting. Justice for Thomas, for twelve victims. But orders: capture alive. He knows Soviet network, intelligence worth more than revenge. If Grace kills him, she's compromised, proves program can't be trusted. The Trapper: "Kill me and you're murderer. Capture me and I'll escape, kill again. End me." Manipulation but truth. Training versus vendetta. She chooses: doesn't kill him. Binds him, secures for extraction. The Trapper mocks: "Good soldier." Grace radios Dockery: target secured. Handler congratulates—passed test, proved program works. Grace feels empty. Helicopter inbound. But fourth cache still active. Needs disarm code. He refuses. Twelve hours until detonation.

---

## ACT 3: CONFRONTATION & RESOLUTION (Chapters 23-30)

Extraction turns to chaos. The Trapper's final play forces Grace's hand. She gets her revenge but pays the cost. Justice versus duty resolved ambiguously. Hollow victory.

### Chapter 23: Extraction

Helicopter arrives piloted by CIA contractor. Grace loads The Trapper aboard—bound but conscious. Pilot radios Dockery: target secured, RTB to Anchorage. The Trapper silent during flight, watching Grace. She's exhausted, wounded, but mission accomplished. Helicopter crosses wilderness toward civilization. Grace finally allows herself to feel it—Thomas is avenged. Not through murder, through duty. She did the right thing. The Trapper sees her face, smiles slightly. "You think you won." Before Grace can react, he moves. Bound hands weren't properly secured—he's been working knots entire flight. Attacks pilot, trying to grab controls. Helicopter lurches violently. Pilot struggling, Grace grabbing for The Trapper. He's fighting for escape—rather die free than face interrogation. Helicopter tilting, door open, wind screaming. The Trapper breaks free from Grace's grip, lunges at pilot again.

### Chapter 24: Split-Second Decision

Chaos in helicopter. Pilot fighting to maintain control, The Trapper attacking him. Grace has split-second decision. Shoot The Trapper, kill valuable intelligence asset, violate mission orders. Or let him potentially crash helicopter, kill all three. Her training says protect mission. Her instinct says eliminate threat. Grace draws Colt .45. The Trapper sees her, knows what's coming. Smiles. "There she is. Thomas's niece. Do it." Grace fires. Double-tap to chest. The Trapper falls backward out open helicopter door. Body drops into frozen wilderness hundreds of feet below. Gone. Pilot regains control, stabilizes flight. Radios emergency: prisoner attempted escape, was neutralized, fell from aircraft. Grace stares down at wilderness. The Trapper's body somewhere in that frozen expanse. Dead. Mission failed—no interrogation. But threat eliminated. Grace holstered weapon. Knows the truth: she allowed that moment. Didn't secure bindings properly. Let opportunity arise. Took it. Got her revenge disguised as duty.

### Chapter 25: Disarm Code

Helicopter returning to Anchorage. Grace realizes: The Trapper is dead, can't provide disarm code for fourth cache. Dead-man trigger activates at noon tomorrow—eight hours from now. Grace radios Dockery, reports situation. Handler furious—target eliminated, intelligence lost, program validation failed. But immediate crisis: pipeline bomb still active. Grace requests diversion to Box Canyon. She'll attempt manual disarm. Dockery authorizes—CIA technical expert will talk her through via radio. Helicopter diverts. Grace rappels into canyon, approaches cache. Examines dead-man trigger mechanism—sophisticated Soviet engineering, tamper-resistant. CIA expert guides her through disarm sequence. Four hours to deadline. Grace works methodically, hands steady despite exhaustion. Cuts wrong wire and entire pipeline network dies. Cuts right wire and she lives. PROJECT CASSANDRA intuition guides her. Trust the wrongness feeling. She cuts wire. Nothing happens. Cache disarmed. Pipeline saved. Grace collapses against canyon wall. Mission accomplished—sabotage prevented. But The Trapper dead, intelligence lost. Did she succeed or fail?

### Chapter 26: Debriefing

Anchorage CIA safe house. Dockery debriefs Grace. Official record: target eliminated during escape attempt, no alternative. Sabotage prevented, pipeline secured, Soviet operation neutralized. Mission success. Unofficially: Dockery knows. Grace let The Trapper create escape opportunity, shot him when she could have subdued him. She chose revenge over capture. Dockery can't prove it but suspects. Grace maintains innocence—followed protocol for hostile prisoner transport, responded appropriately to threat. Dockery lets it go. Program validation is complicated now. Grace stopped sabotage (success) but killed valuable asset (failure). PROJECT CASSANDRA's future unclear. Dockery assigns her administrative leave—recover from wounds, psychological evaluation pending. Grace accepts. Knows she compromised mission for personal reasons. Doesn't regret it. Thomas is avenged. Twelve victims have justice. Soviet saboteur is dead. Intelligence community politics are secondary.

### Chapter 27: Evidence Review

Grace reviews evidence recovered from The Trapper's cabin. Journal entries, photographs, radio logs. CIA confirms Viktor Sokolov's identity—Soviet GRU, wanted internationally, suspected in multiple intelligence operations. His death removes major threat. But interrogation would have revealed other agents, exposed network. That knowledge died with him. Grace examines photos of twelve victims. Thomas's photo among them. All these deaths unavenged by system—staged as accidents, investigations closed. Only Grace's extrajudicial killing brought consequences. She questions if she did right thing. Legally: murder disguised as line-of-duty shooting. Morally: justified execution. Professionally: mission failure. Personally: necessary revenge. Truth exists in gray area between all four. Grace submits report, files evidence. Knows she'll carry this choice forever. Can live with that.

### Chapter 28: Thomas's Grave

Grace visits Thomas's grave in Fairbanks cemetery. First time since recruitment. Tells him it's done—The Trapper is dead, pipeline is saved, justice served. But victory feels hollow. Thomas is still gone. Revenge didn't bring him back, didn't heal wound. Grace thought killing his murderer would mean something. It means The Trapper is dead. Nothing more. She leaves Thomas's hunting knife—recovered from The Trapper's body—on gravestone. Closure feels incomplete. Grace realizes revenge is empty satisfaction. She traded intelligence value and professional integrity for personal vindication. Killed man who murdered her uncle but compromised herself doing it. Thomas would have understood—he was soldier, knew moral compromise of necessary violence. But would he approve? Grace doesn't know. Walks away from grave, snow falling, alone.

### Chapter 29: Psychological Evaluation

Grace undergoes CIA psychiatric evaluation. Standard protocol after traumatic operation. Psychiatrist asks about decision to shoot The Trapper. Grace maintains official story—hostile prisoner, imminent threat, appropriate response. Psychiatrist notes Grace shows no PTSD symptoms, no remorse, clinical detachment. Asks about Thomas Harlow. Grace acknowledges personal connection but claims it didn't compromise professionalism. Psychiatrist skeptical. Recommends continued administrative leave, additional sessions. Grace knows evaluation will determine her future. Pass and she stays operational. Fail and she's desk job or discharged. She performs adequately—shows enough emotion to seem human, enough control to seem stable. Psychiatrist signs clearance with reservations. Grace is operational but flagged. Future missions will be scrutinized. PROJECT CASSANDRA's reputation damaged. Some operatives can't separate personal from professional. Grace proved that.

### Chapter 30: Next Assignment

Three months later. Grace working pipeline maintenance, Maintenance Station Omega. Dockery visits. Brings new assignment: Soviet activity in Aleutian Islands, possible submarine station. Needs operative who knows Alaska, works alone, won't hesitate. Grace questions if PROJECT CASSANDRA still operational. Dockery confirms some factions want shutdown, but her mission had results. Sabotage prevented, enemy eliminated. Messy but effective. Program has conditional approval. Grace considers. Taking it means accepting what she is—operative who'll compromise orders for justice. Not pure professional. But effective. Accepts. Pipeline work feels empty. She's tasted the hunt. Final image: Grace loading gear. Dockery asks if she regrets killing The Trapper. "No. But I regret needing to." Helicopter lifts off. Grace at window, scanning terrain, instinct humming. She's hunter now. Will make same choice again. Justice over duty. That's who she is. Mission complete. Cost paid.
