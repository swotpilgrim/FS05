* Beats:
  - After second equipment failure prediction saves lives, two CIA officers approach Grace at pipeline station. Offer explanation for ability she's never understood—predictive pattern recognition, legitimate cognitive skill not luck.
  - Training would weaponize it for intelligence work. Grace skeptical but intrigued—pipeline work killed her father, maybe her "curse" could serve bigger purpose. Accepts recruitment.
  - Eighteen months at facility learning threat assessment, danger forecasting, trusting gut instinct under operational pressure. Psychological conditioning to override logical analysis when intuition screams.
  - Grace excels—mechanical background gives systems-thinking foundation, wilderness experience provides environmental threat assessment. Graduates top of class. Handler tells her she's ready for real mission.

* Dialogue Topics: CIA officers explaining pattern recognition science, Grace questioning if she's crazy, instructors drilling "trust the wrongness feeling," final evaluation where Grace perfectly predicts simulated ambush.

* Emotional Arc: Grace begins suspicious and defensive, gradually embraces that her ability isn't madness but skill. Finds purpose beyond pipeline drudgery. Graduates confident but unaware she's being prepared for specific mission.

* Key Details: Sterile training facility, pattern recognition exercises on screens, scenario rooms with hidden threats, instructor's mantra "trust the wrongness," Grace's perfect final exam score.

* Purpose: Escalate cat-and-mouse dynamic and show both operative's predatory instincts.

* Beats:
  - Grace follows The Trapper to second explosive cache at pipeline access point near frozen river. He's checking timing device, ensuring operational.
  - She observes from high ground, photographs him through rifle scope. Has clear shot. Could kill him now. Mission orders are capture alive—he's valuable intelligence asset. Grace hesitates.
  - In that moment, The Trapper's head snaps up—senses something wrong. Grace's PROJECT CASSANDRA intuition screams warning. She moves as he fires toward her position. Missed her by inches.
  - He knew she was there. Both disappear into wilderness, repositioning. Tense silence. Grace realizes The Trapper has instincts too—fifteen years deep-cover survival, honed predator awareness. This won't be easy. She withdraws, circles to cache after he leaves. Disarms it. Two caches secured, two more to go.

* Dialogue Topics: Grace's internal debate about kill shot versus capture orders, tactical reassessment after near-miss.

* Emotional Arc: Grace begins confident in hunter role, experiences tension during shot opportunity, feels alarm when detected, ends with grudging respect for opponent's skill.

* Beats:
  - Grace returns to Maintenance Station Omega to warm up and resupply. Intercepts Soviet radio transmission on frequency found in The Trapper's cabin.
  - Moscow handler (Yuri Petrov) pressuring for sabotage execution—pipeline strike scheduled for 72 hours from now. The Trapper responds: complications have arisen, possible CIA presence.
  - Moscow insists mission proceed regardless. The Trapper acknowledges. Grace realizes timeline just accelerated. He'll trigger remaining explosives early if necessary. She has less time than she thought.
  - Radios Dockery with intel. Handler congratulates her on two caches disarmed but repeats orders: capture target alive. Grace questions why solo operative instead of extraction team if he's so valuable. Dockery deflects—CIA resources in Alaska limited, can't risk exposure. Grace's paranoia activates. Something feels wrong about this mission.

* Dialogue Topics: Intercepted Russian between Petrov and Sokolov, Grace's report to Dockery, questioning handler's logic about solo operation, Dockery's evasive responses.

* Emotional Arc: Grace begins focused on tactical update, experiences alarm at accelerated timeline, grows suspicious of Dockery's agenda. Ends paranoid about mission authenticity.

* Key Details: Radio static, Russian language intercept, Moscow handler's pressure, Dockery's voice showing strain, Grace's growing distrust, station's isolation reinforcing paranoia.

Setting: Buried cache site in wilderness
Time: Morning, fourth day

* Purpose: Establish The Trapper as serial killer and intensify Grace's moral conflict about capture-alive orders.

* Beats:
  - While tracking The Trapper, Grace finds buried cache containing trophies—photos of bodies, personal items, journal entries in Russian documenting kills.
  - Twelve victims over fifteen years. Hunters, hikers, geologist, fishing guide. Thomas Harlow is entry number nine. Each kill documented clinically: method, duration, disposal.
  - The Trapper stages deaths as wilderness accidents—bear attacks, falls, exposure. Perfect cover for deep-cover agent eliminating threats who discovered his identity.
  - Grace photographs everything, transmits to Dockery. This is war crimes evidence, multiple murders. The Trapper isn't just spy—he's serial killer who enjoys his work. Grace's resolve hardens. Capture-alive order conflicts with justice. These twelve victims deserve more than intelligence debriefing. She continues tracking, knowing her choice is coming.
