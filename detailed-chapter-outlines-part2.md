  - Grace realizes she's being used—not just to stop sabotage, but as program validation test. If she succeeds professionally despite personal stake, program validated. If she kills for revenge, program discredited. She's pawn in CIA internal politics. Dockery confirms: capture The Trapper alive, prove program works. Grace cuts transmission. Will finish mission her way.

* Dialogue Topics: Dockery ordering extraction, Grace refusing, revelation of deliberate assignment knowing Thomas connection, Grace questioning handler's loyalty and agenda, Dockery framing mission as program test.

* Beats:
  - The Trapper initiates radio contact using CIA frequency—he's been monitoring her transmissions. Proposes deal: he'll reveal other Soviet deep-cover agents in North America in exchange for 48-hour head start.
  - Claims he's burned anyway, Moscow will eliminate him for mission failure. Willing to trade intelligence for survival. Grace questions legitimacy. Real offer or trap?
  - She plays along, agrees to meet. Sets meeting at abandoned pipeline shack. Both arrive armed, wary. The Trapper is weathered, cold-eyed, carrying Thomas's knife on belt.
  - He describes killing Thomas almost fondly—worthy opponent, fought well, took three days to die. Grace's rage barely contained. The Trapper watches her: "You want to kill me. But your orders say capture alive. That's your weakness—you still follow orders." Probing her discipline. Grace maintains control, rejects deal. The Trapper withdraws calmly. "Fourth cache triggers in 24 hours. Find it before then." He's heading to command post to activate final sabotage.

Setting: Box Canyon—narrow granite formation
Time: Morning, fifth day

* Purpose: Spring The Trapper's trap—Grace's intuition leads her into kill box, reversing hunter/prey dynamic again.

* Beats:
  - Grace's PROJECT CASSANDRA intuition pulls her toward Box Canyon—narrow granite formation, quarter-mile long, 50-foot walls. Her gut has screamed wrongness about this location since mission start. Fourth cache must be here.
  - Approaches carefully. Canyon floor shows no obvious signs but instinct insists danger. Grace enters, sweeping for explosives.
  - Finds cache concealed in rock crevice—massive amount of C-4, sophisticated dead-man trigger. If The Trapper doesn't input disarm code by noon tomorrow, triggers automatically. Also triggers if tampered. Grace can't disarm it—needs his code.
  - She's examining device when instinct screams. Dives as rockslide crashes behind her—retreat blocked. Gunfire from canyon rim. The Trapper positioned on high ground, multiple firing positions. Grace pinned in kill box. This was trap. He used fourth cache as bait, knew she'd come. Grace trapped, wounded (leg shot), no escape. The Trapper calling down: "Predictable. Your instinct brought you here. My instinct prepared for you."

Setting: Box Canyon floor, narrow crevice shelter
Time: Afternoon to night, fifth day

* Purpose: Show Grace's survival skills under extreme pressure and psychological warfare from The Trapper.

* Beats:
  - Grace trapped in Box Canyon, wounded and exposed. The Trapper has perfect position—high ground, multiple angles, she's in open kill zone.
  - He's firing controlled bursts, keeping her pinned. Not trying to kill her yet—enjoying the hunt. Grace assesses: leg wound serious but mobile, limited ammunition, no cover, sunset approaching. Temperature dropping fast. If pinned overnight, hypothermia will kill her.
  - The Trapper knows this, settles in to wait. Grace uses last smoke grenade to obscure sight lines, limps to canyon wall. Finds narrow crevice, wedges inside. Defensible but still trapped.
  - Night falls. The Trapper lights fire on canyon rim—psychological warfare, showing his comfort while she freezes. Grace tends wounds, conserves ammunition. Her PROJECT CASSANDRA intuition quiet—no clear escape presents itself. She's in genuine crisis. Mission failed, she's going to die in this canyon. Unless she can turn trap against trapper.

* Dialogue Topics: The Trapper's occasional taunts, Grace's internal survival planning, inventory of remaining resources.

* Emotional Arc: Grace begins in pain and fear, transitions to desperate tactical thinking, experiences growing cold and despair. Ends grimly determined to survive somehow.

Time: Night, fifth day

* Purpose: The Trapper's theatrical nature leads him to confess his crimes—Grace uses this to study his patterns for escape opportunity.

* Beats:
  - The Trapper calls down from rim, conversational. Long night ahead, might as well talk. He describes his career—fifteen years deep cover, perfect operation until Thomas Harlow recognized him from old GRU intelligence photo.
  - Had to eliminate Thomas. Describes murder in detail: caught him in wilderness, tortured for information about who else knew, killed him slowly over three days. Staged bear attack perfectly. Kept knife as trophy because Thomas fought well—respected that.
  - Grace listening from crevice, rage building. The Trapper continues: killed twelve people over years, each elimination necessary for operational security. Enjoys the work—wilderness is perfect killing ground, bodies disappear, accidents believable.
  - Grace realizes he's theatrical, needs audience. Isolation has made him hungry to share accomplishments. She exploits this: asks questions, keeps him talking. While he monologues, she's reading him. PROJECT CASSANDRA training showing his patterns—rhythm of attention, when he's distracted, his tells. Learning him for opportunity.

* Dialogue Topics: The Trapper describing Thomas's capture and death in detail, his philosophy of hunting humans, Grace asking strategic questions to keep him talking, learning his patterns.

* Emotional Arc: Grace begins in rage and pain, forces herself to suppress emotion and listen tactically, experiences horror at detailed confession. Ends coldly analytical, seeing his weakness.

POV: Grace Harlow, first person
Setting: Box Canyon floor
Time: Dawn, sixth day

* Purpose: Grace turns tables through pattern recognition and rage-fueled violence—captures The Trapper for extraction.

* Beats:
  - Dawn breaks. The Trapper descends into canyon—time to finish hunt. Grace appears defeated, weakened by wounds and cold. He approaches cautiously but confidently.
  - Describes how he'll stage her death—fell during pursuit, exposure killed her. CIA will never know truth. Gets within ten feet.
  - Grace's PROJECT CASSANDRA intuition has been tracking his pattern all night. She sees the moment—his weight shifts wrong, attention lapses for one second. She moves. Not away—toward. Tackles him before he can raise rifle.
  - Brutal close-quarters fight. The Trapper is larger, stronger, combat-trained. But Grace is fighting for Thomas, channeling two years of rage into focused violence. Uses canyon environment—smashes his head against rock wall, breaks his rifle, gets Thomas's knife from his belt. Reversal complete. Grace has knife at his throat. Mission parameters echo: capture alive. He's valuable intelligence asset. Kill him and mission fails. Her choice.

* Dialogue Topics: The Trapper's confident description of staging Grace's death, Grace's internal tactical countdown to moment of attack, combat is mostly physical.

Setting: Box Canyon floor
Time: Morning, sixth day

* Purpose: Grace chooses duty over revenge—captures The Trapper alive despite two years of wanting him dead, proving professional discipline.

* Beats:
  - Grace has The Trapper pinned, knife at throat. Two years waiting for this moment. Justice for Thomas, for twelve victims.
  - But orders are clear: capture alive. He knows Soviet network, other deep-cover agents, intelligence worth more than revenge. If Grace kills him, she's compromised operative, proves program operatives can't be trusted.
  - The Trapper talks: "Kill me and you're murderer. Capture me and I'll escape eventually, kill again. End me." Manipulation but also truth. Training versus vendetta.
  - She chooses: doesn't kill him. Binds him with climbing rope, secures for extraction. Did her duty. The Trapper mocks: "Good soldier." Grace radios Dockery: target secured, extraction required. Handler congratulates her—passed test, proved program works. Grace feels empty, not victorious. Helicopter inbound. But fourth cache still has dead-man trigger active. Needs The Trapper's disarm code. He refuses to give it. Twelve hours until detonation.

* Dialogue Topics: The Trapper's manipulation about escaping, Grace's internal debate, radio call to Dockery reporting capture, demand for disarm code, The Trapper's refusal.

* Emotional Arc: Grace experiences conflict between rage and duty, makes difficult choice, feels empty rather than triumphant. Ends professionally satisfied but emotionally hollow, new crisis emerging.

* Key Details: Knife at throat, climbing rope bindings, The Trapper's mocking tone, radio call to Dockery, refusal of disarm code, twelve-hour deadline, helicopter inbound.

* Purpose: The Trapper's escape attempt creates opportunity for Grace to kill him and claim line-of-duty justification.

* Beats:
  - Helicopter arrives piloted by CIA contractor. Grace loads The Trapper aboard—bound but conscious. Pilot radios Dockery: target secured, RTB to Anchorage.
  - The Trapper silent during flight, watching Grace. She's exhausted, wounded, but mission accomplished. Helicopter crosses wilderness toward civilization.
  - Grace finally allows herself to feel it—Thomas is avenged. Not through murder, through duty. She did the right thing. The Trapper sees her face, smiles slightly. "You think you won."
  - Before Grace can react, he moves. Bound hands weren't properly secured—he's been working knots entire flight. Attacks pilot, trying to grab controls. Helicopter lurches violently. Pilot struggling, Grace grabbing for The Trapper. He's fighting for escape—rather die free than face interrogation. Helicopter tilting, door open, wind screaming. The Trapper breaks free from Grace's grip, lunges at pilot again.

* Dialogue Topics: Pilot's status reports to Dockery, The Trapper's mocking comment about winning, chaos during attack, pilot's shouts.

* Purpose: Grace kills The Trapper claiming line-of-duty but knowing she allowed the opportunity—revenge disguised as duty.

* Beats:
  - Chaos in helicopter. Pilot fighting to maintain control, The Trapper attacking him. Grace has split-second decision: shoot The Trapper (kill valuable intelligence asset, violate mission orders) or let him potentially crash helicopter, kill all three.
  - Her training says protect mission. Her instinct says eliminate threat. Grace draws Colt .45.
  - The Trapper sees her, knows what's coming. Smiles. "There she is. Thomas's niece. Do it." Grace fires. Double-tap to chest.
  - The Trapper falls backward out open helicopter door. Body drops into frozen wilderness hundreds of feet below. Gone. Pilot regains control, stabilizes flight. Radios emergency: prisoner attempted escape, was neutralized, fell from aircraft. Grace stares down at wilderness. The Trapper's body somewhere in that frozen expanse. Dead. Mission failed—no interrogation. But threat eliminated. Grace holsters weapon. Knows the truth: she allowed that moment. Didn't secure bindings properly. Let opportunity arise. Took it. Got her revenge disguised as duty.

* Dialogue Topics: Pilot's emergency calls, The Trapper's final words acknowledging Grace's identity, Grace's internal acknowledgment of deliberately created opportunity.

* Beats:
  - Helicopter returning to Anchorage. Grace realizes: The Trapper is dead, can't provide disarm code for fourth cache. Dead-man trigger activates at noon tomorrow—eight hours from now.
  - Grace radios Dockery, reports situation. Handler furious—target eliminated, intelligence lost, program validation failed. But immediate crisis: pipeline bomb still active.
  - Grace requests diversion to Box Canyon. She'll attempt manual disarm. Dockery authorizes—CIA technical expert will talk her through via radio.
  - Helicopter diverts. Grace rappels into canyon, approaches cache. Examines dead-man trigger mechanism—sophisticated Soviet engineering, tamper-resistant. CIA expert guides her through disarm sequence. Four hours to deadline. Grace works methodically, hands steady despite exhaustion. Cuts wrong wire and entire pipeline network dies. Cuts right wire and she lives. PROJECT CASSANDRA intuition guides her. Trust the wrongness feeling. She cuts wire. Nothing happens. Cache disarmed. Pipeline saved. Grace collapses. Mission accomplished—sabotage prevented. But The Trapper dead, intelligence lost. Did she succeed or fail?

* Dialogue Topics: Grace reporting death to Dockery, handler's fury about lost intelligence, CIA technician's disarm instructions via radio, Grace's internal intuitive process choosing correct wire.

* Emotional Arc: Grace begins with realization of new crisis, experiences Dockery's anger, feels focused calm during disarmament despite stakes. Ends exhausted and uncertain about success versus failure.

* Beats:
  - Anchorage CIA safe house. Dockery debriefs Grace. Official record: target eliminated during escape attempt, no alternative. Sabotage prevented, pipeline secured, Soviet operation neutralized. Mission success.
  - Unofficially: Dockery knows. Grace let The Trapper create escape opportunity, shot him when she could have subdued him. She chose revenge over capture. Dockery can't prove it but suspects.
  - Grace maintains innocence—followed protocol for hostile prisoner transport, responded appropriately to imminent threat. Dockery lets it go.
  - Program validation is complicated now. Grace stopped sabotage (success) but killed valuable asset (failure). PROJECT CASSANDRA's future unclear. Dockery assigns her administrative leave—recover from wounds, psychological evaluation pending. Grace accepts. Knows she compromised mission for personal reasons. Doesn't regret it. Thomas is avenged. Twelve victims have justice. Soviet saboteur is dead. Intelligence community politics are secondary.

Target Word Count: 1,700 words
POV: Grace Harlow, first person
Setting: CIA facility, evidence room
Time: Days later

* Purpose: Grace confronts moral complexity of her choice through reviewing The Trapper's crimes—justified execution or professional failure?

* Beats:
  - Grace reviews evidence recovered from The Trapper's cabin. Journal entries, photographs, radio logs. CIA confirms Viktor Sokolov's identity—Soviet GRU, wanted internationally, suspected in multiple intelligence operations.
  - His death removes major threat. But interrogation would have revealed other agents, exposed network. That knowledge died with him.
  - Grace examines photos of twelve victims. Thomas's photo among them. All these deaths unavenged by system—staged as accidents, investigations closed. Only Grace's extrajudicial killing brought consequences.
  - She questions if she did right thing. Legally: murder disguised as line-of-duty shooting. Morally: justified execution. Professionally: mission failure. Personally: necessary revenge. Truth exists in gray area between all four. Grace submits report, files evidence. Knows she'll carry this choice forever. Can live with that.

* Dialogue Topics: CIA analyst's briefing on Sokolov's background, Grace's internal moral debate across legal/moral/professional/personal axes.

* Emotional Arc: Grace begins analytical reviewing evidence, experiences conflict examining victim photos including Thomas, reaches uneasy acceptance of moral complexity. Ends resolved but not at peace.

* Beats:
  - Grace visits Thomas's grave in Fairbanks cemetery. First time since recruitment. Tells him it's done—The Trapper is dead, pipeline is saved, justice served.
  - But victory feels hollow. Thomas is still gone. Revenge didn't bring him back, didn't heal wound. Grace thought killing his murderer would mean something. It means The Trapper is dead. Nothing more.
  - She leaves Thomas's hunting knife—recovered from The Trapper's body—on gravestone. Closure feels incomplete.
  - Grace realizes revenge is empty satisfaction. She traded intelligence value and professional integrity for personal vindication. Killed man who murdered her uncle but compromised herself doing it. Thomas would have understood—he was soldier, knew moral compromise of necessary violence. But would he approve? Grace doesn't know. Walks away from grave, snow falling, alone.

* Dialogue Topics: Grace's one-sided conversation with Thomas's grave, internal realization about emptiness of revenge.

* Emotional Arc: Grace begins wanting to feel closure, experiences disappointment that revenge feels hollow, realizes Thomas is still gone. Ends alone and questioning if she made right choice.

  - Grace acknowledges personal connection but claims it didn't compromise professionalism. Psychiatrist skeptical. Recommends continued administrative leave, additional sessions.
  - Grace knows evaluation determines her future. Pass and she stays operational. Fail and she's desk job or discharged. She performs adequately—shows enough emotion to seem human, enough control to seem stable. Psychiatrist signs clearance with reservations. Grace is operational but flagged. Future missions will be scrutinized. PROJECT CASSANDRA's reputation damaged. Some operatives can't separate personal from professional. Grace proved that.

* Dialogue Topics: Psychiatrist's questions about The Trapper shooting, Grace's carefully calibrated responses, discussion of Thomas, evaluation of PTSD symptoms, clearance decision.

* Emotional Arc: Grace begins performing normalcy strategically, experiences tension during personal questions, feels calculation managing emotional display. Ends cleared but flagged, knowing she's permanently compromised.

* Beats:
  - Three months later. Grace working pipeline maintenance, Maintenance Station Omega. Back to civilian cover. Dockery visits unannounced.
  - Brings new assignment: Soviet intelligence activity in Aleutian Islands, possible submarine tracking station. Needs operative who knows Alaska, works alone, won't hesitate when necessary.
  - Grace questions if PROJECT CASSANDRA still operational. Dockery confirms some factions want shutdown, but her mission had results. Sabotage prevented, enemy eliminated. Messy but effective. Program has conditional approval.
  - Grace considers offer. Taking it means accepting what she is—operative who'll compromise orders for personal justice. Not pure intelligence professional. But effective in field. Accepts assignment. Pipeline work feels empty now. She's tasted the hunt. Can't go back to maintenance. Final image: Grace loading gear into helicopter. Dockery asks if she regrets killing The Trapper. Grace answers: "No. But I regret needing to." Helicopter lifts off over Alaska wilderness. Grace at window, scanning terrain below, instinct humming. She's hunter now. Knows she'll make same choice again when necessary. Justice over duty. Revenge disguised as professionalism. That's who she is. Mission complete. Cost paid. Life continues.

* Dialogue Topics: Dockery's new assignment briefing, Grace questioning program status, acceptance of new mission, final exchange about regret.

* Emotional Arc: Grace begins going through motions at pipeline job, feels pull of operational life when Dockery offers mission, accepts what she's become. Ends resolved in identity as compromised but effective operative.
